Google-Chart-Builder-Prototype
==============================

Produces some of the most common charts based on Google Charts API. Built on AngularJS. Uses Flat UI, Twitter Bootstrap and Colorpicker for Twitter Bootstrap

What doesn't work

* extracting chart as HTML (issue in the data)
* extracting chart as an IMG (issue in the data)
* uplaoding custom data (JSON issue)
* Colorpicker functionaility to bound to the chart
* Table Chart and Scatter Chart (and potentionally many others) don't exist yet
* Pie Chart lacks custom functionality
